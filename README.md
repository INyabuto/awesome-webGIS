# awesome-webGIS
In my GIS development career, I have came across many web GIS projects. A curious search on the web always led me to different websites with a lot of GIS materials, but I was mostly interested in open Projects on Github.

Something I can just clone the code and have it running on my computer. The digging has not been easy. But here I present my findings and hope this can help someone looking for a simple GIS solution, or someone who wants to learn or know how things are done.

By a open project I mean, some application or code someone or some people have wrote, and due to their generousity and open source spirit, have made the code freely available to other developers or users.

This small write up is a wrok in progress. Feel free to open an issue for improvement or an addition

## Web Map Templates 
  ### [Bootleaf](https://github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf)
  Bootleaf is a template for building simple and elegant web mapping applications with Bootstrap and Leaflet.
  
  If you need to bootstrap a simple web map with minimal functionalities, such as vusialization only, this is a good start point. Personaly I think I have use it in many projects as my reference point for some leaflet code.
  ### [Calcite Maps](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-maps)
  This is also a  Bootstrap theme for designing, styling and creating modern map apps, but with the main focus on using it with Esri ArcGIS JS API. I like it because it also encorparates [Esri-leaflet](https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/)
  
## Front End Frameworks

 ## [Terria JS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap)
 TerriaJS is a library for building rich, web-based geospatial data explorers. It uses Cesium and WebGL for a full 3D globe in the browser with no plugins. It gracefully falls back to 2D with Leaflet on systems that can't run Cesium. It can handle catalogs of thousands of layers, with dozens of geospatial file and web service types supported. It is almost entirely JavaScript in the browser, meaning it can even be deployed as a static website, making it simple and cheap to host.
  
 ### [Mapstore](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2)
An Open Source highly modular webgis framework developed by GeoSolutions to create, manage and share securely in a simple and intuitive way maps and mashups created mixing contents served from servers like Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Bing or from server adehering to OGC standards like WFS, CSW, WMS, WMTS and TMS.

### [Boundless SDK ](https://github.com/planetfederal/sdk)
Javascript SDK based on React, OpenLayers and Redux.
 
### [jane-maps](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/jane-maps)
  A framework for rich, composable web maps using React and MapboxGL.Its developers describe  it as a react component for building modular, multi-layer web maps with complex UIs.
  I personally like this one, and use it a lot in my projects.It a must check!..

  
## Databases
 ### [postgis-preview](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/postgis-preview)
 A lightweight express app and leaflet frontend for previewing PostGIS queries. You write your plain SQL, and see results on a map ! How awesome ...
 ### [PGRestAPI](https://github.com/spatialdev/PGRestAPI)
 Node.js REST API for PostGres Spatial Entities. AKA: SpatialServer. It gives you a fully RESTFUL API to your PostGIS database, with your favourite webmapping formats included..If yours doesnt serve GeoJSON, this application will definelty replace it.lol
 ### [opengrid](https://github.com/Chicago/opengrid)
 A user-friendly, map-based tool to combine and explore real-time or historical data.
It is  an open-source, interactive map platform that allows users to explore multiple data sources in an easy-to-use interface.
## Crowd Sourcing Applications
 ### [Nodeshot](https://github.com/ninuxorg/nodeshot)
This is a Django based tools to create crowdsourcing web apps
Its goal itâ€™s to provide some robust tools to build a modern customized crowdsourcing web application quickly.
It is designed to be modular, flexible, configurable and extensible.
### [umap](https://github.com/umap-project/umap)
uMap lets you create maps with OpenStreetMap layers in a minute and embed them in your site.
The developers of the project beleive that the more OSM will be used, the more OSM will be ''cured''
### [osm-tasking-manager](https://github.com/hotosm/osm-tasking-manager2)
Designed and built for Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team collaborative emergency/disaster mapping, the OSM Tasking Manager 2.0 divides an area into individual squares that can be rapidly mapped by thousands of volunteers.
The platform enables collaborative work on specific areas in OpenStreetMap by defining clear workflows to be achieved and by breaking tasks down into pieces.
