# open-GIS
In my entire period in Campus, I have came across many web GIS projects. A curious search on the web always led me to different websites with a lot of GIS materials, but I was mostly interested in open Projects on Github.

Something I can just clone the code and have it running on my computer. The digging has not been easy. But here I present my findings and hope this can help someone looking for a simple GIS solution, or someone who wants to learn or know how things are done.

By an open project I mean, some application or code someone or some people have wrote, and due to their generousity and open source spirit, have made the code freely available to other developers or users.

This small write up is a wrok in progress. Feel free to open an issue for improvement or an addition

## Web Map Templates 
  ### [Bootleaf](https://github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf)
  Bootleaf is a template for building simple and elegant web mapping applications with Bootstrap and Leaflet.
  
  If you need to bootstrap a simple web map with minimal functionalities, such as vusialization only, this is a good start point. Personaly I think I have use it in many projects as my reference point for some leaflet code.
  ### [Calcite Maps](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-maps)
  This is also a  Bootstrap theme for designing, styling and creating modern map apps, but with the main focus on using it with Esri ArcGIS JS API. I like it because it also encorparates [Esri-leaflet](https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/)
  
## Front End Frameworks
  ### [jane-maps](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-maps)
  A framework for rich, composable web maps using React and MapboxGL.Its developers describe  it as a react component for building modular, multi-layer web maps with complex UIs.
  I personally like this one, and use it a lot in my projects.It a must check!..
  
## Databases
 ### [postgis-preview](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/postgis-preview)
 A lightweight express app and leaflet frontend for previewing PostGIS queries. You write your plain SQL, and see results on a map ! How awesome ...
 ### [PGRestAPI](https://github.com/spatialdev/PGRestAPI)
 Node.js REST API for PostGres Spatial Entities. AKA: SpatialServer. It gives you a fully RESTFUL API to your PostGIS database, with your favourite webmapping formats included..If yours doesnt serve GeoJSON, this application will definelty replace it.lol
 ### [opengrid](https://github.com/Chicago/opengrid)
 A user-friendly, map-based tool to combine and explore real-time or historical data.
It is  an open-source, interactive map platform that allows users to explore multiple data sources in an easy-to-use interface.
## Crowd Sourcing Applications
 ### [Nodeshot](https://github.com/ninuxorg/nodeshot)
This is a Django based tools to create crowdsourcing web apps
Its goal itâ€™s to provide some robust tools to build a modern customized crowdsourcing web application quickly.
It is designed to be modular, flexible, configurable and extensible.
### [umap](https://github.com/umap-project/umap)
uMap lets you create maps with OpenStreetMap layers in a minute and embed them in your site.
The developers of the project beleive that the more OSM will be used, the more OSM will be ''cured''
