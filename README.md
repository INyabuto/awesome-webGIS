# open-GIS
In my entire period in Campus, I have came across many web GIS projects. A curious search on the web always led me to different websites with a lot of GIS materials, but I was mostly interested in open Projects on Github.

Something I can just clone the code and have it running on my computer. The digging has not been easy. But here I present my findings and hope this can help someone looking for a simple GIS solution, or someone who wants to learn or know how things are done.

By an open project I mean, some application or code someone or some people have wrote, and due to their generousity and open source spirit, have made the code freely available to other developers or users.

## Web Map Templates 
  ### [Bootleaf](https://github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf)
  Bootleaf is a template for building simple and elegant web mapping applications with Bootstrap and Leaflet.
  
  If you need to bootstrap a simple web map with minimal functionalities, such as vusialization only, this is a good start point. Personaly I think I have use it in many projects as my reference point for some leaflet code.
  ### [Calcite Maps](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-maps)
  This is also a  Bootstrap theme for designing, styling and creating modern map apps, but with the main focus on suing it with Esri ArcGIS JS API. I like it because it also encorparates [Esri-leaflet](https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/)
